"""
Value Objects Module.

Value Objects are immutable objects that are defined by their attributes
rather than a unique identity. They encapsulate domain concepts and ensure
consistency through validation.

Value Objects to be implemented in issue #3.2.2:
- DateRange: Represents a period with start and end dates
- ContactInfo: Encapsulates contact information validation
- SkillLevel: Enumeration for skill proficiency levels
- Email, Phone: Validated primitive wrappers

Value Objects follow these principles:
1. Immutability: Once created, cannot be changed
2. Equality by value: Two VOs are equal if all attributes match
3. Self-validation: Validate on construction
4. Side-effect free: All operations return new instances
